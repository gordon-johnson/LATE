# LATE was my first independent project.
# It is a resource collection game in which the player runs around an ever changing, procedurally generated forest,
# collecting fireflies to light up their surroundings and find their way home.
# But be warned!  The more fireflies you collect the more attention you may draw from enemies.
# The game has some slight pacing issues that needed to be addressed, but overall I consider it a solid attempt at my first undirected and indpendent project.
